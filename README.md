# hivekey

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A self-hosted LLM API key pool. Put all the API keys of an OpenAI-compatible endpoint behind a single URL, and hivekey load-balances requests across them with smart scheduling, automatic retry/failover on 429s and errors, per-key cooldowns, proxy support, and a real-time web dashboard for managing everything. Clients can speak **OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI Responses or Google Gemini** — the pool translates them all to the OpenAI-compatible upstream. Design inspired by [new-api](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api).

## Features

- **One URL, many keys** — expose a single OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint backed by any number of upstream API keys, batch-imported one per line.
- **Multi-protocol compatibility** — clients using the Anthropic SDK (`/v1/messages`, incl. `count_tokens`), the OpenAI Responses API (`/v1/responses`) or the Google Gemini SDK (`/v1beta/models/{m}:generateContent`) are translated to the OpenAI upstream transparently — non-streaming *and* streaming, including tool/function calls, images and protocol-shaped errors.
- **Automatic retry & failover** — on 429 / 5xx / network errors the request is transparently retried with a different key. `Retry-After` is honored, rate-limited keys go into exponential-backoff cooldown, keys that return 401 twice are auto-disabled.
- **Eight scheduling strategies** — smart `adaptive` by default (success rate × first-token speed × throughput × load), plus `round_robin`, `random`, `weighted`, `least_inflight`, `lowest_latency`, `lowest_ttft`, `highest_throughput` — switchable live from the Settings page.
- **Performance-aware routing** — every request records time-to-first-token (TTFT) and tokens/sec per key (EWMA); the metrics feed the scheduler and show up in the dashboard, key tables and logs.
- **Channels with priority tiers** — group keys into channels (one base URL each) with priority failover, per-channel weight, model whitelists (trailing-`*` wildcards supported) and model-name remapping.
- **Real-time dashboard** — live in-flight request table, per-minute traffic chart, persisted daily usage, per-key health/latency/TTFT/throughput/429 stats and cooldown countdowns, pushed over SSE.
- **Full web management** — add channels, batch-import keys, search/paginate/test keys (single or all at once), enable/disable/reset keys, issue client access tokens, tune every scheduler knob — all from the browser.
- **Backup & restore** — export the whole configuration (channels, keys, tokens, settings) as JSON and import it back (merge or replace) from the Settings page.
- **Dark / light / auto theme** — manual toggle or follow the OS.
- **Proxy support** — per-channel outbound HTTP(S) proxy, plus a global fallback (`OUTBOUND_PROXY`).
- **Streaming & usage aware** — SSE responses stream straight through; token usage is extracted from both JSON and streaming responses for stats.
- **Zero-database** — state lives in one JSON file; deploy with Docker in a minute.
- **Bilingual dashboard (i18n)** — English and 简体中文, auto-detected from the browser with a one-click switcher.

## Quick start

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name hivekey \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me-please \
  -v pool-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/kaecho/hivekey:latest   # or build locally: docker build -t hivekey .
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaecho/hivekey.git
cd hivekey
# edit docker-compose.yml (set ADMIN_PASSWORD!)
docker compose up -d
```

### Node.js (≥ 18.17)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaecho/hivekey.git
cd hivekey
npm ci
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me npm start
```

Then:

1. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` and log in.
2. **Channels → Add channel** — set the upstream base URL (e.g. `https://api.openai.com`) and paste your API keys, one per line.
3. **Tokens → Create** — issue an access token for your apps.
4. Point your app at the pool:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-pool-..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}'
```

Any OpenAI-compatible SDK works — set `baseURL` to `http://localhost:3000/v1` and `apiKey` to your pool token. Responses carry `x-pool-attempts` and `x-pool-channel` headers for debugging.

## Using other SDKs (Anthropic / Responses / Gemini)

Upstream channels stay OpenAI-compatible; the pool converts these client protocols on the fly. The same pool token works everywhere (`Bearer`, `x-api-key`, `x-goog-api-key` or `?key=`).

**Anthropic SDK / Claude Code:**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-pool-...
# claude / any Anthropic SDK now routes through the pool (POST /v1/messages)
```

**OpenAI Responses API** (e.g. Codex-style clients):

```python
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:3000/v1", api_key="sk-pool-...")
client.responses.create(model="gpt-4o", input="hello")
```

**Google Gemini SDK:**

```python
from google import genai
client = genai.Client(api_key="sk-pool-...",
    http_options={"base_url": "http://localhost:3000"})
client.models.generate_content(model="gpt-4o", contents="hello")
```

Notes: tool/function calls, system prompts, images (base64), streaming and usage all translate; hosted server tools (`web_search` etc.) are not supported. `/v1/messages/count_tokens` and `:countTokens` are answered locally with an estimate.

## Configuration

All server configuration is via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Listen port |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Listen address |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Dashboard login user |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(empty)* | Dashboard login password. If empty, a random one is generated, persisted and printed to the log |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | *(auto)* | Session-signing secret; auto-generated and persisted if empty |
| `SESSION_TTL_MS` | `86400000` | Admin session lifetime (24 h) |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Directory for `data.json` (channels, keys, tokens, settings) |
| `OUTBOUND_PROXY` | *(empty)* | Global fallback outbound proxy (`http://host:port`); falls back to `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | *(off)* | Number of reverse-proxy hops to trust (usually `1` behind nginx/traefik) so login rate limiting sees real client IPs; also enables the `Secure` cookie flag via `X-Forwarded-Proto` |
| `BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` | `26214400` | Max `/v1` request body size (25 MB) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Console log level: `error` / `warn` / `info` / `debug` |
| `LOG_COLOR` | `auto` | ANSI colors: `auto` (TTY only), `always` (use in Docker), `never` |

Runtime behavior (strategy, retry counts, timeouts, cooldowns…) is configured in **Settings** in the dashboard:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `strategy` | `adaptive` | Key-selection strategy (see below) |
| `maxAttempts` | `3` | Total tries per request (1 initial + retries), each with a different key |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | `300000` | Upstream response/idle timeout |
| `connectTimeoutMs` | `10000` | Upstream TCP connect timeout |
| `cooldown429BaseMs` | `30000` | Base cooldown after a 429 (doubles per consecutive 429, capped by `cooldownMaxMs`; upstream `Retry-After` wins when present) |
| `cooldownErrorBaseMs` | `5000` | Base cooldown after a 5xx/network error (exponential) |
| `cooldownMaxMs` | `900000` | Cooldown ceiling |
| `disableAfterConsecutiveFailures` | `8` | Auto-disable a key after this many consecutive failures (`0` = never) |
| `retryOn` | `429, 401, 403, 500, 502, 503, 504` | Upstream status codes that trigger failover to another key |
| `allowAnonymous` | `false` | Let clients call `/v1` without a pool access token |
| `logLimit` | `1000` | Finished requests kept in the in-memory log |

## Concepts

- **Channel** — one upstream base URL plus its settings: priority, weight, optional model whitelist, model-name mapping (e.g. rewrite `gpt-4o` → `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` for that upstream), auth header style (`Authorization: Bearer` by default, configurable for other schemes), and an optional per-channel proxy.
- **Key** — an upstream API key inside a channel. Keys are batch-imported one per line; duplicates are skipped. Each key tracks its own health: success/failure counts, 429s, EWMA latency, cooldown state.
- **Access token** — what *your* apps use to call the pool's `/v1` endpoint (`sk-pool-…`). Create/revoke them in the dashboard.

### Scheduling

For each request the pool picks candidates from the **highest-priority tier** of enabled channels that serve the requested model (lower tiers are used only when every key above is cooling down, disabled or already tried), then applies the strategy:

| Strategy | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `adaptive` *(default)* | Weighted-random over a composite score: smoothed success-rate² × first-token-speed factor × throughput factor × in-flight penalty × channel weight. Keeps exploring keys while favoring healthy fast ones |
| `round_robin` | Even rotation across keys |
| `random` | Uniform random |
| `weighted` | Random, weighted by channel weight |
| `least_inflight` | Key with the fewest in-flight requests |
| `lowest_latency` | Key with the lowest EWMA response latency (new keys first) |
| `lowest_ttft` | Key with the lowest EWMA time-to-first-token (new keys first) |
| `highest_throughput` | Key with the highest EWMA tokens/sec (new keys first) |

### Retry & key health

- Retryable upstream failures (`retryOn` codes + network errors) trigger an immediate retry with a **different key**; the failing key is benched:
  - **429** → cooldown for `Retry-After` if sent, else exponential backoff starting at `cooldown429BaseMs`.
  - **5xx / network error** → exponential cooldown from `cooldownErrorBaseMs`; after `disableAfterConsecutiveFailures` consecutive errors the key is auto-disabled.
  - **401/403** → treated as a bad key: two consecutive occurrences auto-disable it.
- Non-retryable client errors (400/404/…) pass through unchanged and don't hurt key health.
- If every attempt fails, the last upstream error is returned; if no key is available at all, the pool answers `503` with a JSON error.
- A successful response fully resets the key's failure streaks.

## HTTP API

Everything the dashboard does is a plain REST API you can script against — authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <session token>` from `POST /api/auth/login`:

```
POST   /api/auth/login              {username, password}
GET    /api/overview
GET    /api/channels                POST /api/channels        PUT/DELETE /api/channels/:id
GET    /api/channels/:id/keys      POST /api/channels/:id/keys   {"keys": "sk-a\nsk-b\n..."}
POST   /api/channels/:id/test-keys  (test every enabled key, bounded concurrency)
PATCH  /api/keys/:id               POST /api/keys/:id/reset  POST /api/keys/:id/test
DELETE /api/keys/:id               POST /api/keys/batch-delete   {"ids": [...]}
GET    /api/tokens                  POST /api/tokens          PATCH/DELETE /api/tokens/:id
GET    /api/logs                    GET  /api/requests/live
GET    /api/settings                PUT  /api/settings
GET    /api/export                  POST /api/import          {"data": <backup>, "mode": "merge"|"replace"}
GET    /api/events                  (SSE: live request/key/overview events)
```

## Notes

- The pool forwards `/v1/*` verbatim to `<baseUrl>/v1/*` (a trailing `/v1` on the base URL is stripped, so both `https://host` and `https://host/v1` work).
- `Accept-Encoding: identity` is requested upstream so token usage can be read from response bodies.
- API keys are stored in plain text in `DATA_DIR/data.json` — protect that directory. Keys are always masked in the dashboard, logs and API responses unless explicitly revealed.
- Run the pool behind HTTPS (reverse proxy) if it's exposed publicly, and set a strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm test        # unit + integration tests (mock upstream: retries, 429s, streaming, auth)
npm run dev     # auto-restart on change
```
